                    Hey! I'm DMClone or rather Dani. I'm a game dev from The Netherlands and I mainly
                    focus on Unity with C#. I've done a decent amount of map development in Hammer for the game Team
                    Fortress 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always been interested in game design, analizing games like Half Life 2, Hades, Doom and
                    Overwatch.
                    Looking into why such choses have been made and how they affect the way players interact with the
                    game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Past the current game development course I'm doing currently I also did a web development course.
                    This gives me insight on how users view and experience media that I make.
                    Allowing me to see how I can improve my projects and where I can take them next.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Modding and messing with game files has always been a guilty pleasure of mine, whether they're minor
                    or major changes, it's always fun to see how the game treats these changes (also making memes from
                    them).

                    Outside my work I also have 2 dogs, Pip and Puck. They've been amazing pugs and are awesome to
                    cuddle after a long day of coding.
                    I've also had a French and English Bulldog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Story based games like Bioshock and Witcher 3 we're eye openers for me. Getting me intrigued years
                    after their release.
                    Bioshock in particular has been a game I keep coming back to, the storytelling and world building
                    are impeccable. It was the first game I developed theories for: like what the ending of Bioschock
                    Infinite means and how it could continue from there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Competitive gaming has also peeked my interest, mostly Overwatch and recently Marvel Rivals. Getting
                    top 20 in Loki (hardest character in the game).
                    Reading and anticipating the meta, reading patch notes and trying new ways to not only win but to
                    also have fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also been a big fan of a little known game as Hero Tale by Weird Johnny Studio. An amazing rpg
                    where it surprises you by challenging you to play again and getting faster times. Each milestone you
                    get offering you incentives to keep trying for better run optimization. This is the first game I've
                    learnt to treat as a speedrun game instead of throwing it away and playing another rpg.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Renowned Soundtrack oriented games like Undertale/Deltarune, Terraria and Hollow Knight have made me
                    interested in how music can create an atmosphere and how it can influence the way you play a game.
                    It made me curious into trying it myself, though so far I've dabbled in midis.
                </p>

                    I'm a huge fan of the Youtube channel SiIvaGunner, which is a channel that posts high quality rips
                    of video game music.
                    The channel is known for its remixes and humorous takes on video game music, often incorporating
                    unexpected elements or memes.
                    Users submit rips they made to the channel. They often recreate the music from scratch, sometimes
                    even being scarily accurate.
